Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Goal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The goal of the application is to implement a simple Panorama Stitching
 operation.
 The input of the application is a set of images found in a specific folder.
 The objective is to try to stitch all the images in a bigger panorama image.
 The result image can be shown in a new windows or saved into a new file.
 We are going to provide options to configure the behavior of the program
 passing parameters to it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Prerequisites
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start reproducing the following application you are going to need to
 install and configure the following prerequisites, with the right link
 to the download:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- Python 2.7.10 | https://www.python.org/downloads/
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
- OpenCV 2.4.12 | http://opencv.org/downloads.html
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To use the OpenCV library in the Python environment we need to copy the
 build for python to the right folder.
 So you need to move the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

cv2.pyd
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 file, that can be found in 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

{OPENCV_FOLDER}
\backslash
build
\backslash
python
\backslash
2.7
\backslash
x86
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, to the folder 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Python27
\backslash
Lib
\backslash
site-packages
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

.
 After that you can use the OpenCV library in Python.
 Now run the following code using python:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset listings
inline false
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

import cv2
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout

print cv.__version__
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If everything went well you are going to see the version of opencv: 2.4.12.
 Now we are ready to continue.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Brief Approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The approach to the application is a Python implementation of a simple panorama
 stitching algorithm.
 It is used the functional programming paradigm.
 We are going to use functions as elements and apply it to types ( images
 ) using high-order functions.
 A high-order function is a function that has another function as parameter.
 We are going to use high-order functions like map that receives a function
 and a list, then apply that function to every element on the list and store
 its result in the same list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Briefly the pipeline consists of the following steps:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
1.
 Load all images to the program
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
2.
 Generate features information using the SIFT method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
3.
 Using the features descriptors, match features between images using some
 match method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
4.
 Select the best matches using the ratio criteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
5.
 Find the correct homography using the matches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
6.
 Apply transformation to the images and stitch them together in one image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
7.
 Keep repeating steps 2 to 6 for every image until is only left one panorama
 image.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more detailed explanation of the steps is provided in the Approach Section.

\begin_layout Subsection
Theory behind the application
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the case of the panorama stitching, we have two images taken from the
 same camera that intersects in some part.
 The idea is to transform the images in order to stitch them together in
 one big image.
 We assume that the two images were taken from the same position, that is
 that does not occurred any or little translation between the images.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Let 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{1}$
\end_inset

be a pixel in the first image projected from a 3D point 
\begin_inset Formula $X$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $x_{2}$
\end_inset

 be the same projection but in the second image.
 We are assuming that we know the camera parameters by using some kind of
 camera calibration.
 We can denote the camera intrinsics matrix as K.
 To finalize the pinhole camera model we need to define the rotation and
 translation matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case we can consider both images to be at the origin and not having
 any translation between them.
 One of the images can be considered to have no rotation and the other image
 to use the rotation from the first to it orientation.So we have:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{1}=K[I|0]X
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
x_{2}=K[R|0]X
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where K is the intrinsic matrix of the camera and X is the 3D point in the
 world.
