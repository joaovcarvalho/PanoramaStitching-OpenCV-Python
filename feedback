=====
- Introduce the subject to the professor before demonstrate the demo.
- Consider high-level problems challenges.
- Be specific for the technical problems and solutions that you encountered in the assignment // Don't say that you encoutered problems with opengl/opencv without specific solutions or description of the problems.
- Don't refer to things like perspective matrix without a citation.
- Don't simply approach little technical problems with trial and error // Flip image of opencv or matrix because of the different axis between opengl/opencv.
- OpenCV is robust only with rigid markers // Probably not a good idea just to wave the paper in front of the camera.
- Problem of the origin between the corners of the chessboard should have been explained.
- Cite degrees of freedom to solve calibration and how much images do you need to calibrate the camera.
